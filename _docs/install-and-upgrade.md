description: Install and upgrade The Lounge on Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, from npm releases, using Docker, from source, and more
order: 2
---

{% include toc.md %}

## Debian and Ubuntu based distributions

First, make sure latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) <abbr title="Long Term Support">LTS</abbr> version or latest current release is installed
with `dpkg -s nodejs | grep '^Version'` and `node --version`. If not, follow the instructions given on the
[official documentation](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

Then download `thelounge.deb` located at the bottom of [the latest release](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/releases/latest).

Finally, open a terminal and install the downloaded package using:

```
sudo apt install ./thelounge.deb
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
This method requires root access. Install The Lounge using [Yarn from an npm release](#from-npm-releases) if you cannot use `sudo`.

This also sets up a `systemd` service, enabled during the install, that you can
control with `systemctl status|start|restart|stop|...`.

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

Its configuration file is located at `/etc/thelounge/config.js`.
To learn how to configure The Lounge, go to [the configuration section](/docs/configuration). To learn how to add users, read [the users section](/docs/users). The `thelounge` command needs to be run as the `thelounge` user, e.g. `sudo -u thelounge thelounge --help`.

To upgrade The Lounge, simply follow these steps again after downloading a new
`thelounge.deb` file, and restart the service.

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies).

## Arch Linux

The Lounge is [available in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/thelounge/).

Please follow the
[Arch Linux documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)
to install this package from the AUR. For example, to install it using an AUR
helper such as [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):

```
yay -aS thelounge
```

Then enable and start the `thelounge.service` unit using:

```
systemctl enable --now thelounge.service
```

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

The package provides both a system and a user service to allow you to run The
Lounge as your liking. Simply build and install the AUR package, and start the
service:

- **[System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd):**
  `systemctl start thelounge.service`. The configuration is stored in
  `/etc/thelounge/config.js`and runs as `thelounge` user.
- **[User](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User):**
  `systemctl --user start thelounge.service`. The configuration is stored in
  your home directory in `~/.thelounge/config.js`.

To configure The Lounge, go to
[the configuration section](/docs/configuration).

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies).

## macOS

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
The below has only been tested on x86 Intel-based Macs. This may or may not work on ARM-based M1 Macs.

1. Install [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools)
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. Open Terminal
4. Run `brew install gcc node yarn`
5. Follow the ["From npm releases" section](https://thelounge.chat/docs/install-and-upgrade#from-npm-releases) for the remaining steps

## From npm releases

Installing the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thelounge) directly
allows you to use stable releases on systems where we do not provide native
packages.

First, make sure you have these installed on your system:

- The latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version (or latest current release). See the [official installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
- [Yarn 1 (classic)](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/). See [official installation instructions](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/docs/install).

Then install The Lounge using:

```
yarn global add thelounge
```

Start the server manually using:

```
thelounge start
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
Note that installing from npm or yarn does not daemonize nor autostart The Lounge.

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

Read more about how to use The Lounge from the command line in
[the CLI usage section](/docs/usage).

Its configuration file is located at `~/.thelounge/config.js`. To configure The
Lounge, go to [the configuration section](/docs/configuration).

To upgrade The Lounge, simply re-run the `install` command above, and restart it.

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies).

## Docker

Official Docker images of The Lounge are made available for every new release in
the [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/thelounge/thelounge).

To run a container using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
use [this example `docker-compose.yml`
file](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
and run:

```
docker-compose up --detach
```

Otherwise, run:

```
docker run --detach \
	--name thelounge \
	--publish 9000:9000 \
	--volume ~/.thelounge:/var/opt/thelounge \
	--restart always \
	ghcr.io/thelounge/thelounge:latest
```

For more details about using The Lounge with Docker, refer to
[the official repository](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker).

## Running from source

Running The Lounge from source ensures you are running the most recent codebase.

{: .alert.alert-warning role="alert"}
While running The Lounge from source allows you to test the latest features, it
may be unstable or insecure. This is not production-ready, so use at your own
risk!<br>
It is also not recommended to run this as a `root` user.

First, make sure latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version (or latest current release) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are installed on your system. See [official instructions for Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and [official instructions for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install).

The following commands install the development version of The Lounge:

```
git clone https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge
cd thelounge
yarn install
NODE_ENV=production yarn build
# pick a folder which is in your $PATH env var, ~/.local/bin here
ln -s $(pwd)/index.js ~/.local/bin/thelounge
```

Start the server manually using:

```
thelounge start
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
Note that installing from source does not daemonize nor autostart The Lounge.

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

Read more about how to use The Lounge from the command line in
[the CLI usage section](/docs/usage).

Its configuration file is located at `~/.thelounge/config.js`. To configure The
Lounge, go to [the configuration section](/docs/configuration).

To upgrade The Lounge, simply `git pull` the repository, re-run the `install` and
`build` commands above, and restart it.

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies).
